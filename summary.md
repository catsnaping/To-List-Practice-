# My GitHub Journey

I started learning GitHub with a simple to-do list project, and it’s been an amazing ride! Here’s what I accomplished:

- Created my first repository: `To-List-Practice-`
- Added and edited a `todo.txt` file to track tasks
- Learned to create an issue and close it
- Made a branch, added a `notes.txt` file, and merged it into `main`

I’m excited to keep exploring GitHub and try more projects!
